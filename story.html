            <h2>The Sword of the Temporal Palace Who Delved into the Abyssal Myriad Palace</h2>
<p>
Aeons ago on this very planet both deities and mortals roamed alongside each other. There existed both those who served the deities and those who opposed the deities. Deities belong to various pantheons. Amongst those pantheons the significant pantheons are Ragnoros, Olympia, Devanghariuos, and Gladias. Each pantheon possesses their own religion and religious branches.
</p>

<p>
Alongside the deities there also lingered the demonic beings commonly known as Danu’s children. The term referring to them derives from the legend of an omnipotent primordial who manifested the world, defining all but leaving him undefined. The primordial god is akin to Abraham of my previous world. They rank from various ranks; lesser demons, greater demons, thrones of power, princes of the demonic realm (7 deadly sins), and finally the demon king (cardinal sin).
</p>

<p>
In this world mortals possess magic bestowed upon them by the spirits and a primordial affinity of light, dark, or chaos. Light is given to those who revere the deities, dark for those who oppose them, and chaos for those in the middle. There are four major magic affinities; fire, water, earth, and wind.
</p>

<p>
Specifically, there is flame, blaze, and inferno within the fire affinity of increasing ranks. For water there exists tide, ice, and flow. For wind there is zephyr, gale, and tempest. Finally, there is ground, root, and mountain for the earth affinity.
</p>

<p>
There are also combined affinities for those who possess multiple basic affinities, and for those who possess multiple advanced affinities they are given potential for an advanced combined affinity. Storm and tremor derive from wind and water. Spark and lightning derive from water and fire. Soil and wood from earth and water. The remainder are considered forgotten or forbidden magic affinities due to the loss of knowledge.
</p>

<p>
The remaining knowledge of magic is known from the remaining texts from the ancient Dragonia kingdom’s archmage, Solomon. Solomon is also known as the King of Magic. As the archmage of the Dragonia kingdom, he was also a contractor of a dragon king as per legend.
</p>

<p>
Dragons possess dragon tongue which allows them to use mana within words, thus contractors of such a beast are given a wider understanding of magic. Only the Dragonia kingdom kept records of magic, however most were destroyed. All we know of are the four major affinities, half of the combined affinities, and the light and dark affinities. Dark is known as forbidden, and light is known as holy.

<hr>

<p>
I am <strong>Atlas le Seshan</strong>, the fiftieth patriarch of the Seshan family’s little brother. However, truly I’m a reincarnator. Formerly, I lived on Earth, a world forsaken by the deities. My name back then was Maximus, a nine-to-five office worker in software development.
</p>

<p>
One day I died after being struck by a truck driven by a runaway fugitive. I awoke as a baby in this new world as the illegitimate child of the Seshan family, Atlas le Seshan, an indirect lineage of the Seshan family.
</p>

<p>
I was bestowed the grace of the world through a system meant to help me adapt. I was given rewards for completing tasks and consequences for failing them. By the age of sixteen, following my father’s death, I found myself enlisted in the <strong>Temporal Palace</strong>.
</p>

<p>
The Temporal Palace is an institute for noble scholars and knights—an academy for the upper echelon and those who display immense potential. It is a place where all pantheons nurture intelligence and strength.
</p>

<p>
As an illegitimate child, I was the target of prejudice. I tolerated much of it, but one day I could no longer endure their mockery. They insulted my honor as a Seshan. In this world, honor is everything.
</p>

<p>
I am of the swordsman class. I endured countless struggles at the Temporal Palace, yet they diminished my honor. Suddenly, a vague serpent-like yet human figure appeared before me, the surroundings engulfed in infernal shadows.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“I am Serpentarius. I am the one born of virtue, fallen to sin, yet standing in chaos. I greet you, great adversary, successor of the once feeble lord candidate.”
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Stunned, I asked, “Serpentarius, who is the lord candidate you speak of, and who are you truly?”
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“The feeble lord candidate is the man revered as a child of the gods—Lord Ananta von Seshan, contractor of Shesha, the serpent of the abyss. I am the forsaken god’s first child, doomed to be forgotten like my father, Danu.”
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
“I shall offer you a chance. A chance for greatness no man other than that feeble lord obtained. Power rivaling gods and demons alike. What do you say, boy?”
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Recalling the insults to my honor, I accepted without hesitation.
</p>

<p>
“I, Atlas le Seshan, illegitimate bloodline of the Seshan family, offer my sincerest gratitude. I accept your offer.”
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“Very well. Welcome to the Abyssal Myriad Palace. Leave all worldly possessions and reenter this world anew. Enter the Forest of Danu and seek the tallest peak. There lies the entrance.”
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I returned to the moment my malice spiked. The nobles had already left. I bid farewell to the few who were kind to me and submitted my resignation to the academy. Then I departed for the Forest of Danu.
</p>

<p><em>← Approximately two years later of training and traveling →</em></p>

<p>
At last, I arrived at the Forest of Danu. I climbed the tallest mountain and now stood at its peak, gazing upon the supposed entrance. After years of living as a rogue—earning coin through escort missions and hunting requests—I had finally arrived.
</p>

<p>
Below my feet lay the <strong>Abyssal Myriad Palace</strong>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“Welcome, vagrant traveler. You may not enter until you prove yourself through a rite of passage.”
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A giant liquid serpent emerged.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“I am Vasuki, lord of waters and naga of the demonic sea. I welcome your challenge, if you dare.”
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
“I am Atlas le Seshan. I wish to enter the Abyssal Myriad Palace.”
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“I decline. You wield a blade filled with malice. You value title and prestige over life and death. I would rather die than allow such a greedy and envious fool to enter.”
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
“But I have come so far! Why deny me?” I shouted.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“You are envious and greedy for power. You worship prestige over love and life. You are no virtue. Danu created all equal—only values differ. We shoulder burdens, not lives. You seek bloodshed.”
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The last words I heard were:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“Bereaving Fist. You shall be doused in the chalice of bereavement.”
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
My consciousness drifted away as my temper surged.

            <h2>The Sword of the Temporal Palace Who Delved into the Abyssal Myriad Palace</h2>
<p>
    <!-- Introductory Paragraph| Ars Paulina -->
    Aeons ago on this very planet both deities and mortals roamed alongside each other. 
    There existed both those who served the deities and those who opposed the deities. 
    Deities belong to various pantheons. 
    Amongst those pantheons the significant pantheons are Ragnoros<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"><span class="footnote">[1]</span></a>, Olympia<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"><span class="footnote">[2]</span></a>, Devanghariuos<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"><span class="footnote">[3]</span></a>, and Gladias<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"><span class="footnote">[4]</span></a>. 
    Each pantheon possesses their own religion and religious branches.
</p>

<p>
    <!-- Ars Goetia -->
    Alongside the deities there also lingered the demonic beings commonly known as Danu's children. 
    The term referring to them derives from the legend of an omnipotent primordial being who manifested the world, defining all but leaving him undefined. 
    The primordial god is akin to Abraham of my previous world. 
    They rank from various ranks; lesser demons, greater demons, thrones of power, princes of the demonic realm (7 deadly sins<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"><span class="footnote">[5]</span></a>), and finally the demon king (cardinal sin).
</p>

<p>
    <!--Magical Affinities Introduction | Ars Theurgia-->
    In this world mortals possess magic bestowed upon them by the spirits (also known as elementals) and a primordial affinity of light, dark, or chaos. 
    Light is given to those who revere the deities, dark for those who oppose them, and chaos for those in the middle. 
    There are four major magic affinities; fire, water, earth, and wind.
    <!--Basic -> Advanced Pillar Magical Affinities-->
    Specifically, there is flame, blaze, and inferno within the fire affinity of increasing ranks. 
    For water there exists tide, ice, and flow. 
    For wind there is zephyr<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref"><span class="footnote">[6]</span></a>, gale<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref"><span class="footnote">[7]</span></a>, and tempest<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref"><span class="footnote">[8]</span></a>. 
    Finally, there is ground, root, and mountain for the earth affinity.
    <!--Combined Magical Affinities-->
    There are also combined affinities for those who possess multiple basic affinities, and for those who possess multiple advanced affinities they are given potential for an advanced combined affinity. 
    Storm and tremor derive from wind and water. 
    Spark and lightning derive from water and fire. 
    Soil and wood from earth and water. 
    The remainder are considered forgotten or forbidden magic affinities due to the loss of knowledge or the scale of destruction it brings.
</p>

<p>
    <!-- Lesser Key of Solomon-->
    The remaining knowledge of magic is known from the remaining texts from the ancient Dragonia kingdom's archmage, Solomon<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref"><span class="footnote">[9]</span></a>. 
    Solomon is also known as the King of Magic. 
    As the archmage of the Dragonia kingdom, he was also a contractor of a dragon king as per legend.
    <!-- Solomon Backstory-->
    Dragons possess dragon tongue which allows them to use mana within words, thus contractors of such a beast are given a wider understanding of magic. 
    Only the Dragonia kingdom kept records of magic, however most were destroyed. 
    All we know of are the four major affinities, half of the combined affinities, and the light and dark affinities. 
    Dark is known as forbidden, and light is known as holy.

<hr>

<p>
    I am <strong>Atlas<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref"><span class="footnote">[10]</span></a> le Seshan</strong>, the fiftieth patriarch of the Seshan family’s little brother. 
    However, truly I’m a reincarnator<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref"><span class="footnote">[11]</span></a>. 
    Formerly, I lived on Earth, a world forsaken by the deities. 
    My name back then was Maximus, a nine-to-five office worker in software development.
    One day I died after being struck by a truck driven by a runaway fugitive<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref"><span class="footnote">[12]</span></a>. 
    I awoke as a baby in this new world as the illegitimate<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref"><span class="footnote">[13]</span></a> child of the Seshan family, Atlas le Seshan, an indirect lineage of the Seshan family.
</p>

<p>
    I was bestowed the grace of the world through a system meant to help me adapt. 
    I was given rewards for completing tasks and consequences for failing them. 
    By the age of sixteen, following my father’s death, I found myself enlisted in the <strong>Temporal Palace</strong>.
    The Temporal Palace is an institute for noble scholars and knights—an academy for the upper echelon and those who display immense potential. 
    It is a place where all pantheons nurture intelligence and strength.
</p>

<p>
    As an illegitimate child, I was the target of prejudice. 
    I tolerated much of it, but one day I could no longer endure their mockery. 
    They insulted my honor as a Seshan. 
    In this world, honor is everything.
</p>

<p>
    I am of the swordsman class. 
    I endured countless struggles at the Temporal Palace, yet they diminished my honor. 
    Suddenly, a vague serpent-like yet human figure appeared before me, the surroundings engulfed in infernal shadows.
</p>

<p>
    The mysterious figure said, “I am Serpentarius<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref"><span class="footnote">[14]</span></a>, I am the one born of virtue, fallen to sin, yet standing in chaos. I greet you great adversary, the successor of the once feeble lord candidate.”
</p>

<p>
    I was stunned and inquired, “Serpentarius, who is the lord candidate you speak of and who are you truly?”
</p>

<p>
    “The feeble lord candidate I speak of is none other than the man revered by men as a child of the gods, Lord Ananta von Seshan. 
    The very contractor of Shesha<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref"><span class="footnote">[15]</span></a>, the serpent of the abyss. 
    I am the forsaken god’s first child, doomed to be forgotten like my father, Danu…”, responded Serpentarius. 
    Then Serpentarius then proceeded to probe me by stating, “I shall offer you a chance… A chance for greatness no man other than that feeble lord I mentioned obtained. 
    A power so great it rivals gods and demons alike. 
    What do you say boy?”
</p>

<p>
    While I was still processing and recalling the remarks of my peers, insulting my honor, I decided to accept the offer and go all in. 
    I then respond, “I, Atlas le Seshan, illegitimate bloodline of the Seshan family offer my sincerest gratitude, as I am willing to accept your offer.”
</p>

<p>	“Very well, then I welcome you to the Abyssal Myriad Palace. 
    Leave all worldly possessions and reenter this very world a new being. 
    Enter the forest of Danu and find the tallest peak amongst the mountain range, there you shall find the entrance.”, Serpentarius stated prior to disappearing.
</p>

<p>
    ← Approximately 2 years later of training & traveling. →
</p>

<p>
    At last, I finally arrived at the forest of Danu. 
    I've climbed the tallest mountain, and now I stand at the peak looking at the supposed entrance. 
    After years of going rogue and earning some coin through escort missions and small hunting requests, I’ve finally made it. 
    Now I await what lingers just ahead.
</p>

<p>
    Below my feet is the Abyssal Myriad Palace, the place Serpentarius told me about. 
    Throughout my journey I occasionally was able to ask Serpentarius for more information pertaining to his offer. 
    In total I’ve compiled that the Abyssal Myriad Palace is the place where the most powerful techniques are contained.
    The resting place of Danu within this world.
</p>

<p>	“Welcome vagrant traveler, you who seems of esteemed backgrounds, you may not enter until you prove yourself through a rite of passage.”, says a giant liquidy serpent. 
    It says, “I am Vasuki<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref"><span class="footnote">[16]</span></a>, lord of waters and naga of the demonic sea. 
    I welcome your challenge if you dare…”
</p>

<p>
    I then declare that, “I am Atlas le Seshan, I wish to enter the Abyssal Myriad Palace.”
</p>

<p>
    “I decline, for one who wields a blade filled with malice, you who focuses on title and prestige rather than life and death. 
    I’d rather die than allow such a foolish greedy and envious bastard to enter this palace.”, said Vasuki.
</p>

<p>
    “But I’ve come so long yet you dare deny me! Why?!”, I shouted.
</p>

<p>
    Vasuki calmly stated, “You are too envious of others and greedy for power. 
    You focus on prestige and honor rather than love and life. 
    You are hold no virtue. 
    Danu created all equal, the only difference is our values. 
    You take traits of the true demons of the other realms, unlike the demons of this realm who are truly just those who wield diligence and patience rather than the remainder. 
    We resemble evil to take burdens not lives. 
    You are insolent and strive to shed the blood of others.”
</p>

<p>
    The next moment the last words I heard were “Bereaving Fist, you shall get doused in the chalice of bereavement.” 
    The next moment my consciousness drifted away as my temper grew.
</p>
